=============

Tests anything, anyhow.

The purpose is to develop functionality to test developer code written to solve specific problem statements. The functionality should include :

1/ Multiple programming language support
2/ Web and command line interface
3/ Developer identification through emailed tokens that serve as one time passwords
4/ Provision for testers to write code that generates inputs, outputs and comparator functions.
5/ Ability for testers to define the presentation of input problem statement and output results. 
6/ Archival and statistics gathering
7/ Security for individual developer and the system
8/ Isolation of the developer execution context
9/ Resource control, termination through timeouts
10/ Provide only the ability for developers to write functions. No scope for interactions with standard inputs, outputs, filesystem.
