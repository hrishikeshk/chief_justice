=============

Test anything, to your requirements.

The purpose is to develop functionality to test developer code written to solve specific problem statements. There are two kinds of users : the developer who writes the code to be tested and the tester who can write code that can define test cases and run the developer code. The framework will provide tools and functions to the tester to be able to test a given piece of code easily.

The framework functionality should include :

1/ Multiple programming language support : To be able to test code written in different programming languages. First priority to C++, then to proceed to Javascript and Haskell. Priority : Medium

2/ Web and command line interface : Developers should be able to use from command line as well as web. Priority : High.

3/ Developer identification through emailed tokens that serve as one time passwords. Priority : Low.

4/ Provision for testers to write code that generates inputs, outputs and comparator functions. Priority : High

5/ Ability for testers to define the presentation of input problem statement and output results. Priority : Low

6/ Archival and statistics gathering : Priority : Low.

7/ Security for individual developer and the system. Priority : Medium

8/ Isolation of the developer execution context. Priority : Medium

9/ Resource control, termination through timeouts. Priority : High

10/ Provide only the ability for developers to write functions. No scope for interactions with standard inputs, outputs, filesystem. Priority : High
